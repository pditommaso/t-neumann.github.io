# Hello world!

I was repeatedly gently pushed towards writing a couple of blogs posts of all the obstacles I bothered people on various [Gitter channels <i class="fab fa-gitter" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://gitter.im) with, so I finally made it happen.

Since I hate anything related to web development, HTML, CSS, JS - you name it - hosting Jekyll on GitHub is the most I can reasonably do. I'm actually quite happy that it requires little CSS and HTML and can be mostly put together via Markdown.

To glue this minimal website together, I shamelessly forked the [Minimal mistakes <i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) template and checked out at code from from [Maxime Garcia <i class="fab fa-github" aria-hidden="true"></i>](https://github.com/maxulysse/maxulysse.github.io) for some stuff I liked from the blog's I looked at.

The plan is to put up posts here with anything regarding to Bioinformatics, reproducible pipeline engineering and occasionally rocket science and orbital mechanics.

Cheers
