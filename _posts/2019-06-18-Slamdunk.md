For the past couple of years I was involved in the development of [SLAMseq](http://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.4435), a sequencing technology for time-resolved measurement of newly synthesized and existing RNA in cultured cells. Originally developed by the lab of [Stefan Ameres](https://www.imba.oeaw.ac.at/research/stefan-ameres/), the lab of my boss [Johannes Zuber](https://www.imp.ac.at/groups/johannes-zuber/) extended the approach with pharmacological and chemical-genetic perturbations in order to identify direct transcriptional targets of any gene or pathway ( [Muhar et al, Science 2018](http://doi.org/10.1126/science.aao2793) ).

Processing and interpreting this data required novel analysis methods, so I was given the opportunity to team up with a good friend of mine - [Philipp Rescheneder](https://github.com/philres) - to develop [Slamdunk](https://t-neumann.github.io/slamdunk/) which we recently published in [BMC Bioinformatics](http://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-019-2849-7) and is generally applicable to any nucleotide-conversion containing dataset.

This post will quickly highlight the main functionality, findings and features.
