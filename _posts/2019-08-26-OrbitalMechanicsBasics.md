I was always fascinated by rockets, space in general and zero-gravity environments, however the Math's involved always deemed too complex for me. However, through the playful and still complex approach of [Kerbal Space Program](https://www.kerbalspaceprogram.com/) (KSP) - it is an awesome game I totally recommend to anybody remotely interested in space exploration - I picked up interest lately again and started reading into orbital mechanics, propulsion systems and related stuff in more detail.

This blog series is dedicated to summarising basic concepts at definitely super simplified and probably sometimes oversimplified and not entirely correct level.

The easiest concept for me to grasp, since once can do it quite interactively in KSP is the concept of orbits and orbital changes through orbital maneuvers.

So this very first post of this series will cover my basic understanding of the concept of orbits.

## Ellipse

Let's start of with refreshing our memory what an ellipse is - cause that is what most relevant orbits for this blog series will look like.

$$mean = \frac{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}}{n}$$
